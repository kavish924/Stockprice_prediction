## üöÄ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a robust time-series forecasting model for stock prices. It leverages historical stock data to train an LSTM network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems. The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end workflow, from loading and cleaning the data to building, training, and evaluating the predictive model.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and formats raw stock data for time-series analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates additional technical indicators to improve model performance, including:
    - Moving Averages (MA): 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Bollinger Bands (Upper and Lower)
    - Percentage Price Change
    - Volume Moving Average
    - High-Low Spread
- **Advanced Model Training**:
    - Implements `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting.
    - Uses `ReduceLROnPlateau` to adjust the learning rate dynamically.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using a variety of metrics:
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    - R-squared (R¬≤)

## üìä Dataset

The model is trained on historical stock data for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** from January 2016 to December 2023. The dataset (`AAPL_stock_data.csv`) should contain the following columns:
- `Date`
- `Close`
- `High`
- `Low`
- `Open`
- `Volume`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training the LSTM model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data scaling and evaluation metrics.
- **google colab**: For interactive development and documentation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn
    tensorflow
    ```
    Then, run the installation command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Place your dataset file (e.g., `AAPL_stock_data.csv`) in the root directory of the project.
2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Open the `stockprice_prediciton.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.

## üß† Model Architecture

The LSTM model is constructed as a `Sequential` model in Keras with the following layers:

1.  **LSTM Layer 1**: 50 units, `return_sequences=True`
2.  **Dropout**: 20%
3.  **LSTM Layer 2**: 50 units, `return_sequences=True`
4.  **Dropout**: 20%
5.  **LSTM Layer 3**: 50 units, `return_sequences=False`
6.  **Dropout**: 20%
7.  **Dense Layer**: 25 units, ReLU activation
8.  **Dropout**: 10%
9.  **Output Dense Layer**: 1 unit

The model is compiled with the `Adam` optimizer and `Mean Squared Error` as the loss function.

## üìà Results

The model was evaluated on the test set, yielding the following performance metrics:

| Metric                      | Value        |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Mean Squared Error (MSE)    | 0.0096       |
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE)   | 0.0787       |
| Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) | 0.0977       |
| MAPE (%)                    | 9.06%        |
| **Accuracy (100-MAPE) (%)** | **90.94%** |
| R-squared (R¬≤)              | 0.1868       |
